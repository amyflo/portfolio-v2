            The page you're looking for does not exist. Or it does.. if you were
            looking for a gif of a cute cat reaching for a high five. <strong>(High five, little guy!)</strong>

          <p>
            While we're here, did I mention that I'm always looking for new
            opportunities? In fact, I happen to have a rather fancy piece of
            paper called a <a href="/">resume</a> that you might want to check
            out. Or you can <Link to="/about">learn more about me here!</Link>
          </p>
          <Link to="/">Take me back home!</Link>
        </Col>
