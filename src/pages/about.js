        <h1>
          Hi, I'm Amy.
        </h1>

        <h3>Studying Computer Science and Psychology at Stanford from
          Los Angeles.</h3>
        <p>
          Here is a reminder to anyone on my corner of the internet that behind
          this website is a real human bean. I am a daughter, sister,
          granddaughter, and friend.
        </p>
        <p>
          What motivates me has always been my family and grandparents who
          inspire me to make the most out of my life, reminding me to stay
          upbeat despite failures and setbacks. I want to be measured not by my
          professional achievements but by the vibrancy of my life. After a gap
          year working from home, I cultivated my love for frequent trips to my
          grandparents, cooking cultural recipes, blending frozen fruit
          smoothies, gardening, journaling and taking care of my pet fish,
          George.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am easily touched by acts of kindness and hope to create a positive
          impact in the world. I am inspired by the many, many mentors, friends,
          and random individuals that I meet, virtually or physically. I know
          that there are stories that are out there, untold, that I would like
          to share in my work and journey. I aspire to be a good person first
          and everything else second.
        </p>
        <h3>This is what I care about.</h3>

        <p>
          I am a designer who learned how to code because I was frustrated with
          not knowing what happens after the handoff for a design. During the
          pandemic, I taught myself HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and currently
          am learning Swift / SwiftUI. I wanted to figure out how the pixels I
          pushed translated into real tools and webpages. Learning programming
          languages has made me understand the challenges for developers to
          build UI. Thus, Iâ€™m passionate about creating design systems,
          productivity solutions, and flexible, fast frontend.
        </p>
        <p>
          I care about inclusivity and social change â€“ I led in student
          government at the height of the pandemic, advocating for sexual
          violence protections, fundraising for the King Institute,
          international student visa protections, and racial justice. I also led
          my own #BlackLivesMatter campaign titled #CommissionsForChange,
          raising close to 37 thousand dollars in donations from illustrations
          and corporate matching. I think that the tech world has room to be
          more compassionate, empathetic, and authentic in how we can solve
          problems for users of all needs.
        </p>
        <h3>What I do: the "professional" stuff.</h3>
        <p>
          For work, I translate components to code in React and Sass and build
          the design system at the Federal Reserve Board. I also intern at
          Airpals, a minority-led courier delivery startup based in Brooklyn,
          focusing on our consumerâ€™s purchasing flow. Iâ€™m a mentee for the
          LinkedIn Women [in] Product RiseIn program, where Iâ€™m crafting my journey in
          product management and design. Iâ€™m also engineering an open-source
          project in SwiftUI through Appleâ€™s Swift Mentorship Program under
          guidance from Craig Clayton, Sr. iOS Engineer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Iâ€™ve designed for Lenovo, the U.S. Census Bureau, American Civil
          Liberties Union, Movement for Black Lives, and Council of
          American-Islamic Relations â€“ to name a few. Iâ€™m also passionate about
          design education and previously taught graphic design as Managing
          Editor at the Stanford Daily. In other stints, I researched culture
          for the Stanford Tech History Project and consumed dozens of
          psychology papers as a Research Assistant at the Stanford Culture and
          Emotion Lab.
