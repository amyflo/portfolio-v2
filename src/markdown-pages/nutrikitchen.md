## Introduction

Designed for people with limited mobility, dietary restrictions, and specialized medications, Nutrikitchen is a hub for managing your wellness and kitchen without ever leaving the app. In this concept app, I participated in a team of two with my partner, Tracy Do. Nutrikitchen was a finalist for Adobe College + Ring Creative Jam, scoring in the top 10 out of 130 teams!

- **Team members:** Tracy Do
- **Role:** Product Designer
- **Type:** Design Competition
- **Tools:** Adobe XD
- **Duration:** June 2021 (7 days)

## Challenge

### Prompt

>>> “Your challenge is to provide peace of mind and help people install, operate, or share devices and information to improve their surveillance, communication, temperature, and entertainment around the home and their neighborhood. Design an inclusive third-party mobile app for a specific persona with special needs to help bridge the technology gap.”

### Concept

Nutrikitchen is an all-in-one smart kitchen and health app that understands your medical needs. It functions as a companion to smart kitchen devices that makes it easier for people to manage their diet, lifestyle, and cooking as a centralized app. Nutrikitchen empowers people of all abilities and health needs to manage their lifestyle and kitchen safely and with delight.

## Overview

### Constraints

- Mobile app that solves an accessibility need
- Work with new or existing smart devices
- Both of us were first-time users to Adobe XD
- Brief project timeline to complete

### Users

To start our design process, we decided on designing around these three groups who we felt would benefit most from a smart kitchen app.

## About the event

![Banner from College + Ring Creative Jam from Adobe.](../images/nutrikitchen/acjbanner.jpg)

### Adobe College + Ring Creative Jam

Adobe College + Ring Creative Jam was an event for student designers across the United States, Canada, Australia, or New Zealand. Teams have a full week to work. All submissions are scored by a judging panel of professional designers. At the Finale, finalist teams present live to a panel of expert judges from Ring and Adobe XD.

## Process

### Defining the problem space

To start our design process, Tracy and I went through the phases of the design thinking canvas, thinking clearly through the people, challlenges, storytelling, problem, solutions, management, vision and impact. We used this as a gauge to evaluate the strength of our ideas and make sure that we were always creating with our users in mind.

## Ideation

### Early features

Before we started designing, Tracy and I wanted to determine which features our app should have and where they should live. Using post-it notes, we moved ideas around our artboard until we felt comfortable and confident about the placement of our features.

![Several columns of post-it notes describing feature ideas for Nutrikitchen](../images/nutrikitchen/brainstorm.png "Brainstorm of features we wanted to include in our app")

### User flow

For the user flow of our app, Tracy and I mapped out the different interactions in our app based on our initial brainstorm of features. We decided to color code our interactions in the user flow to ensure that we knew all the screens and actions we wanted to include. This also served as a reference for us later when prototyping our design.

### Wireframes

To create our wireframes, we referenced styles from Adobe XD UI Kits. It was difficult to wireframe at first because both of us were new to Adobe XD and were sometimes working asynchronously on the project. Because of a tight schedule, we jumped from wireframing to visual design after agreeing on each screen.

### Design System

We built a modular, component-based design system to prioritize consistency and usability across our product. For our design system, we struggled with choosing a color palette that would fit our concept. We gained experience on customizing reusable assets and built branding and components as part of our app. We wanted the Design System to portray comfort and ease and displayed through cooking and health. We chose a color palette that plays into the food and nutrition theme.

![Design system guide broken down into components, color, and illlustrations.](../images/nutrikitchen/designsystem.png "We created our own design system and built our branding!")

### Prototyping

Prototyping on Adobe XD was new for us and we had multiple screens with complex actions and microinteractions. We relied heavily on our user flow diagram to plan out interactions in our app and took advantage of Adobe XD’s smart-animate and timing features to create visual delight in our screens.

> Solution #1: Smart Refrigerator (Dietary Restrictions)
Nutrikitchen regulates your dietary needs by keeping track of the foods you eat and what’s inside your refrigerator.

- Alert to buy groceries if food is running low / almost expired
- See nutrition details of all foods in your fridge
- Recommend foods that users can and can’t eat with their diet

![Black and white wireframes based on new app concept design for Google One Today.](../images/nutrikitchen/solutions/Solution1.png "Snapshot of flow designed for people with dietary restrictions")

> Solution #2: Smart Stove (Limited Mobility)
Nutrikitchen helps people control kitchen appliances from your phone without the physical stress of cooking. Through Camera View and heat-detection, our app understands when you’re cooking and will safely monitor your next meal.

- Recommend modes of cooking based on your meals
- Autonomy over your cooking experience
- Override and/or cook manually if needed

![Black and white wireframes based on new app concept design for Google One Today.](../images/nutrikitchen/solutions/Solution2.png "Snapshot of flow designed for people with limited mobility")

> Solution #3: Medications & Reminders (Specialized Medications)
Using motion detection, Nutrikitchen will alert you when you grab foods that may be hazardous for your health or interfere with your medication.

- Recommend foods that users can/can't eat with their medication
- Medication reminders customized to your times
- Warnings and safety reminders about your medications

## Results

### Awards

> We became Top 10 finalists out of 130 teams!

Our app was evaluated on the following criteria:

1. Does the solution address a target audience and their needs?
2. Does the prototype solve the problem in an innovative way?
3. Is the user experience and interface intuitive?
4. Is visual design used in a thoughtful and meaningful way?

![Nutrikitchen finalist screen from team DoLo](../images/nutrikitchen/finalist.png)

We received notification that we made it to the top 10 and had a few days to prepare for the next round! As finalists, we presented in the Finale with a live 3-minute demo of our app and its user flow.

### Feedback

> "This is definitely a really, really cohesive app in terms of the designs and the concept, too. I think the illustrations are really great, and the theme is tied together really well!" - Justin Fulller, Amazon / Ring (Product Experience)

After our presentation, our judges gave feedback on our app design, valuing its layout and understanding of design principles the most. They offered us advice on how to improve our app to make it more accessible and easy to understand for individuals like the elderly.
