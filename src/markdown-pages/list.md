## Interests

### Hobbies
* I love gardening with my parents and currently have started a veggie garden that brings me some peace. 
* I have a pet fish named George who likes swimming around and spitting watter in the air whenever he's hungry. Not a big deal to most to have a pet fish, but it's been so nice having a small friend to accompany me during the pandemic.
* I used to be a piano player, and I've been meaning to pick that up again even though it has been a few years since I've really practiced.

### Skills/tools I want to learn
* React Native & React Hooks
* Typescript (or just more experience in JS)
* Blender: how to animate better and in 3D!
* MERN stack
* Ruby on Rails
* Swift
* SQL
