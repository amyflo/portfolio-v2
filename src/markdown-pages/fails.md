I wanted to create a failure resume so that I can reflect on my career journey. Coming to Stanford, I felt that I had to be a certain type of student and person. 

I didn't have any experience in the tech industry or with computer science before arriving, and comparing myself against peers with more resources or more time in the field made it harder for me to break in and be confident in my work. 

As a designer who also struggled during the pandemic to find roles and get even past a resume screen many, many times, I wanted to normalize the failures I've had to get to where I am today in hopes that it can inspire me to be better in the future!
