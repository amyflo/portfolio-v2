## Introduction

The Census Bureau was struggling with helping small businesses understand complex data tools and methods. The **lack of structured, digestible courses** left small businesses overwhelmed when trying to learn new tools that could help them understand their markets and withstand pressures faced by COVID-19.

I redesigned the entire learning management system for the Census Academy. In this case study, I focus on its core: **a new approach to data skills courses for small businesses.**

## Problem

My team wanted to create more engaging online courses geared toward small businesses. While we had a few courses available on the website, they existed only as text and embedded YouTube videos. We wanted to teach users in a more interactive way and build a better infrastructure for a learning management system. I was challenged to come up with a redesign as part of my fellowship with the U.S. Census Bureau that would be a part of a federal proposal for data education.

### What I didn't know before

Before this project, I had never heard of user experience before. I joined the Civic Digital Fellowship with Coding it Forward with zero knowledge of user research. Everything you see in this case study was self-taught from a combination of Medium, online courses, heavy reading, and great mentorship from the folks at the Census.

### Examining the old flow

Here is what it looks like when a user takes a course through Census Academy.

![Screenshot of a YouTube video on a webpage for Module 1 of Census Data with R](../images/c_academy/screenshot.png "Screenshot of a Census Academy course, Census Data with R")

Each course exists as one long webpage with several embedded YouTube videos. Because there is no interaction with the user on the site, there is no incentive for a user to learn through the Census Academy courses. Even if a user does complete the course, there is no way of documenting their learning or measuring whether or not they have learned the material.

---

### Too much burden on the user

Our target users were small business owners impacted by COVID-19. There were multiple pain points throughout the process of discovering / selecting a course and taking it that created friction in the learning process.

> A big priority for us was reducing the cognitive load it takes to enter and complete a course, and being able to measure quantitative data from our learners on the site.

---

## Research

As part of the project, we wanted to understand how small businesses use data tools to make business decisions. This was especially time sensitive because we wanted to consider the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on how small businesses would respond to our site.

---

### üìö Understanding the existing data education market

We examined how competitors in the e-learning space structured their courses to support interactive learning in a competitive analysis.

> We learned that a successful online course prioritizes user retention through a gamified approach to learning, using progress tracking and rewards like points or certificates.

This process took two weeks because we tested more than 15 different sites to completion before deciding on an itemized list of features that we were most interested in including in our design. Those were included in a project proposal that I had to get approved by our Acting Chief of the Customer Liaison and Marketing Services Office before I could start designing.

### üìä Small businesses and data solutions go hand in hand

When used effectively, data can be extremely powerful for finding new customer leads, measuring sales, and understanding a local market.

#### [67% of small businesses](https://smallbiztrends.com/2020/03/data-analytics-trends.html) are spending more than $10K a year on analytics

#### 83% of our user research participants rely on data analytic tools to make business decisions

> ‚Äú[Before the pandemic] we started working with a bunch of people who've essentially gone out of business, like brick and mortar stores. Most of them are non-existent. Our future was always going to be online.‚Äù - Participant 3

Despite these benefits, there is a high barrier to entry for using data. Through our user interviews, we learned there were two common reasons why: data tools were 1) expensive and 2) difficult to use. The Census Bureau already offers [eleven free data tools](https://www.census.gov/topics/business-economy/small-business/data/data-tools.html) that cater to small businesses. Our goal was to make them easier to learn. Thus, our focus shifted away in our design from teaching courses on data generally to teaching people how to use data tools.

## üîç Wireframes

### Creating for accessibility with USWDS

A new redesign needed to be scalable and easily buildable, so this design was based on components from the U.S. Web Design System, primed for accessible, mobile-friendly government websites.

![Set of wireframes created during my brainstorms](../images/c_academy/wireframes.png)

One of the key reasons we decided to use this design framework in the first place is because of the difficulty government groups have in approving software. This was a constraint that my team and I had to work with to make sure that some of the ideas we had that could affect the backend of this product could still be approved.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Design

### The old user flow

Before we tackled the redesign, we wanted to discuss as a team how the user flow of a course could be fixed. First, we mapped out the current site's user flow.

**Key questions we arrived at:**

1. How might we know if a user learned the material?
2. How might we measure progress throughout the site?
3. How might we break down this design into manageable chunks?

![Flow diagram in 3 parts: Course Discovery, Taking the Course, Course Completion](../images/c_academy/user_flow_diagram.jpg)

---

### Revising the user flow

To fix pain points in the previous version of the Census Academy, I tackled three parts of the old flow:

1. **Course Discovery:** How users are finding our courses and selecting them
2. **Taking the Course:** How we retain users on the site
3. **Course Completion:** How we measure user progress and site interaction

---

#### New flow #1: Course Discovery

For the course discovery, we wanted to create a dashboard where users could save, resume, and get recommended courses. We introduced this to help present any cognitive overload that a user might face when looking for a course.

![User flow diagram of discovering a course](../images/c_academy/coursediscovery.jpg)

---

#### New flow #2: Taking the course

For the course discovery, we wanted to create a dashboard where users could save, resume, and get recommended courses. We introduced this to help present any cognitive overload that a user might face when looking for a course.

![User flow diagram of taking the course](../images/c_academy/takingcourse.jpg)

---

#### New flow #3: Course Completion

At the end of a course, we wanted a way for users to feel valued and incentivized to complete more courses. We added rewards like badges and certifications for completion, and redirected users back to the dashboard afterward where they can discover more courses to take.

![User flow diagram of completing a course](../images/c_academy/coursecompletion.jpg)

---

## Solution

After finalizing our designs, I prototyped the screens on InVision so that we would be able to compare the changes made from the original design. We also used our prototype in user research later on when we went on to validate our design.

![Mockup of the Census Academy](../images/c_academy/mockup3.png "Solution Preview")

---

### ‚úÖ Solution #1: Course Discovery

#### Solution 1.1: Combining topics and courses into one page

The Census Academy website has a Courses page as well as resource pages for each of its six topics. Because of the duplicative amount of work it would require the Census Academy team to maintain these pages, we decided to restructure the topics page to include the courses, allowing users the option to toggle between six icons to change the page topic.

![Screenshot of before and after course page](../images/c_academy/coursepage.png)

- **Design cues:** The icons used in the redesigned course topic pages are consistent across the Census Bureau. I decided to reinforce those brand icons so users familiar with other Census websites would easily understand where they are.

- **Efficient workflow:** The Census Academy had a small team and maintaining the site was already a challenge. By combining these pages into one, it would make it easier and more efficient for the content manager on the team to update the website.

---

#### Solution 1.2: New layout for cards

One of the flaws with the old card design was that there wasn‚Äôt enough information to understand the course. Furthermore, the tags (ex: ‚ÄúResearch‚Äù on the leftmost card) categorizing the courses would often obscure the course image or be harder to see on darker images, limiting its accessibility.

![Screenshot of before and after card designs](../images/c_academy/cards.png)

- **Course Card design:** I gave more white space to the card and emphasized relevant information in the new course card design. This would make it easier for users to read and align with accessibility principles. I also added the description for each course into the card layout so that a user would not have to open each page to know what each course covers, improving each card's utility.

- **Course recommendations:** I suggested a new card layout that would give recommendations to users on courses they should take. As a reusable component, this card could be used throughout the site, offering a new selection for users who may be struggling to pick a course. Users can also rate the recommendation quality, helping the team to better recommend courses in the future.

---

#### Solution 1.3: Course overview

Previously, looking at the course description was extremely text-heavy and deterred users from diving into the content.

![Screenshot of before and after course overview](../images/c_academy/courseoverview.png)

- **Prevent information overload:** I broke down the content into more manageable sections which would allow a user to get information about the course at a quick glance through the hero section, but still scroll down to read more if they were interested.

- **Save for later:** Adding an option to save for later would be a useful feature for users who might want to take a course in the future. This also integrated with our dashboard idea, so users would be compelled to create accounts in order to access what they‚Äôve saved.

---

### ‚úÖ Solution #2: Taking the Course

#### Solution 2.1: Video and quizzes

![Screenshot of before and after course modules](../images/c_academy/coursemodules.png)

- **Collapsible Sidebar:** With the sidebar, a user can easily find where they are in a course and revisit a module that they have already learned.

- **Video and Knowledge Checks:** Users can learn through video, and quiz questions that would allow for a more diverse curriculum design.

- **Learning reinforcement:** We reused alert banners from the USWDS as an answer checker so that users can easily get feedback on how they did so far.

---

### ‚úÖ Solution #3: Course Completion

#### Solution 3.1: Rewards and Incentives

![Screenshot of new dashboard for completing courses](../images/c_academy/coursedashboard.png)

- **Reward system:** Badges were a way to help us easily reward users with short-term gratification and gamify the online courses to make them more personal. This was something that was important to our Census Academy team, as we ideated on how we could leverage badges as a marketing opportunity.

- **Certification:** Certification can be really powerful for small businesses in demonstrating their expertise if in a data-adjacent field. We wanted to give this option as a way for small businesses to offer more advanced training for employees if needed.

- **Track learning and Recommendations:** The dashboard is where users can resume courses at will, taking into account the often busy schedule of small businesses. Through the dashboard, users can also get suggestions on courses that they should take using the card layout designed for course discovery.

---

## Validate

To test our new course design, we developed a challenge to teach the User Group how to use Census Business Builder with over 20 questions and follow-ups and two guided activities through the prototype. The prototype was built on InVision and user research was conducted over the span of two weeks.

We gathered usability tests that we conducted during our research into a report shared with our team and the Census Business Builder developers on the accessibility of Census products. [Please contact me](mailto:amyflo@stanford.edu) if you‚Äôd like to learn more about our user research.

> ‚ÄúHaving the walkthrough of the data [from the course] was the most beneficial. I got to see the potential of the data. To me, that's the real power of the site.‚Äù - Participant 5

From our user interviews with six small businesses, we gained valuable insights into the future of the product! While I didn‚Äôt stay on the team to work on this further, here are a few suggestions from our interviews that are in the works:

### User Suggestions

- Would like an interactive walkthrough of Census Academy
- Would like the ability to share completed courses and Data Challenges on LinkedIn
- Would like certification for mastering a course or multiple Census tools instead of certificates for just one tool.

## What‚Äôs next?

This redesign was presented to the leadership and the Director of the U.S. Census Bureau during the Civic Digital Fellowship Demo Day. The project was also submitted to the U.S. Census Bureau‚Äôs 2021 Transformation Showcase.

### Takeaways

If I were able to continue working on this project, I would definitely prioritize building a more clear design cycle into the team. While I really loved my internship and my work, I could have instead focused on a smaller aspect of the project that could be easily shippable as a proof of concept.

As my first internship, I often felt imposter syndrome when presenting ideas or getting feedback on designs. Looking back, this experience taught me how to be more confident in public speaking and communicating with a team.
